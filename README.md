# QRP_LABS_WSPR
A wspr transmitter and general coverage receiver using the QRP Labs arduino shield and receiver module.\
Headless design, no display or switches.  Computer controlled with WSJT-X, HRD, or stand alone transmit operation.\
A Canaduino WWVB receiver was added to provide time correction.\
A display and encoder were added, so no longer headless.

Status:  Works well.
